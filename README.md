Entertainment Tracker (Preferred Idea)
Blurb:
This app will help users track movies and TV shows they’ve watched or want to watch. It will pull data from an external API like The Movie Database (TMDB) to provide detailed info (titles, posters, ratings). Users can create an account, save shows to a watchlist, mark them as watched, and rate or review them. This solves the common problem of forgetting what you've seen or what's next on your list. The app will use both an external API (for show data) and a custom API (for user accounts and lists).


“Social” App for a Niche Community
Blurb:
This would be a social platform for a niche group — for example, plant lovers or dog owners. Users could create profiles, post updates/photos, like and comment on each other’s content, and connect with others. The goal is to build community and share experiences. The app would rely heavily on a custom API with endpoints for login, posts, friends, and comments. Optionally, it could integrate something like Google Maps to find local meetups or parks.


Habit/Wellness Tracker
Blurb:
A personal dashboard where users can track habits, log workouts, or monitor mental health. This app addresses the challenge of staying accountable with personal goals. Users can log daily activities, see progress over time, and set custom reminders. Data could be stored through a custom-built API, but we could also explore public health or fitness APIs to enrich the experience (e.g., exercise suggestions or nutrition info).
